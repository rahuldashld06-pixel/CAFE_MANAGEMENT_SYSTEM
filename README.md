# Cafe Management — multi-tenant SaaS

Flask + MySQL cafe management application. Any number of cafes sign up
through `/register`; each gets its own menu, staff, orders, billing and
branding, fully isolated from the others.

**Setup and deployment instructions: [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).**

---

## What it does

- **Public signup.** `/register` creates a cafe and its first admin owner.
- **Categories and menu.** Categories, food items with photos, prices.
- **Inventory.** Stock levels drive availability automatically — an item
  at zero stock disappears from the order screen.
- **Orders.** Multi-item orders, with cancel and complete actions and a
  live order-status feed.
- **Billing.** A bill per order, cash/card/UPI, and optional Razorpay
  online payment with server-side signature verification.
- **Reports.** Revenue, top items and trends for the current cafe.
- **Staff accounts.** Admin, manager, cashier and staff roles. Non-admins
  are restricted to ordering, food, inventory and billing.
- **Admin OTP login.** Admins with a mobile number on file confirm a
  6-digit code after their password.
- **Per-cafe branding.** Each cafe sets its own display name, logo and
  sign-in photo.

## How tenant isolation works

Every business row (`categories`, `foods`, `orders`) is tagged with the
owning cafe's `user_id`, and carries a `cafe_id` alongside it. Bills are
isolated through their order; inventory through its food item. User
management, branding and reports filter on `cafe_id` directly.

The owner id is written back to `cafes.owner_user_id` the first time it
is resolved, so it cannot drift when admins are added or deactivated.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- MySQL 8 (any managed provider — Aiven, PlanetScale, Railway)

No database dump to import: the app creates and migrates its own schema
on first run. `docs/schema.sql` is a reference copy for review, or for
provisioning by hand when the runtime user cannot execute DDL.

## Layout

```
app.py               All routes and application logic
wsgi.py              WSGI entry point for gunicorn
config.py            Optional local config (gitignored)
requirements.txt     Python dependencies
Procfile             Process definition for Render/Heroku
render.yaml          Render blueprint
runtime.txt          Pinned Python version
.env.example         Every supported environment variable
docs/DEPLOYMENT.md   Step-by-step setup and deployment guide
docs/schema.sql      Reference database schema
docs/FIXES.md        What was broken before, and how it was fixed
templates/           Jinja2 templates
static/              CSS and static assets
tests/smoke_test.py  Offline end-to-end test suite
tests/upgrade_test.py Legacy-database upgrade test suite
```

## Tests

```bash
python tests/smoke_test.py     # expect PASSED: 37   FAILED: 0
python tests/upgrade_test.py   # expect PASSED: 19   FAILED: 0
```

Both run in memory against a SQLite stand-in — no database or network
needed.

`smoke_test.py` takes two cafes through the full lifecycle and asserts
that neither can read or modify the other's data.

`upgrade_test.py` covers the migration of a database carried over from
the older single-cafe app: missing unique constraints, duplicate rows
already present, the rule that a paid bill is never deleted in favour of
a pending duplicate, and constraint detection by shape rather than by
index name.

## Security notes

- `SECRET_KEY` is mandatory in production; the app refuses to start
  without it.
- Passwords and OTP codes are hashed (`werkzeug.security`); OTP codes are
  single-use and deleted once verified.
- CSRF tokens are required on every state-changing request.
- Razorpay checkout responses are signature-verified server-side and
  webhooks are HMAC-verified with an amount check.
- Session cookies are HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, and Secure in production.
- Self-service password reset requires the account's registered mobile
  number.
- Never commit `.env` or `config.py`.

## Known limitations

- **Usernames are unique platform-wide**, not per cafe. Two cafes cannot
  both have a user called `admin`. Sign-in therefore needs only a
  username and password, with no cafe selector.
- **CSRF tokens are injected into forms by JavaScript** in `base.html`.
  Forms built dynamically after page load need the token added manually,
  and the app will not accept form submissions with JavaScript disabled.
- **Images are stored in the database** as `MEDIUMBLOB`. This is the
  right trade-off on hosts with ephemeral disks and no object storage,
  but at large scale you would move them to S3 or similar.
- There is no billing/subscription layer for the cafes themselves —
  signup is open to anyone with the URL.
